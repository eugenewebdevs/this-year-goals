# This Year Goals

## About
This is a documentOverall objectives for the current year. We may or may not hit all the goals.

Always keep in mind there is nobody making money off this meet up so any volunteering is appreciated.

This is mostly just thoughts and this document is subject to change at anytime.

## Eugene Web Devs

### Help?

Currently adding some volunteer people could make Eugene Web Devs a better experience.

- AV. Understanding the technical needs of venues to both present and live stream well.
- Video editing. Small edits to youtube stream videos to cut out the intros and probably the Q and A
- Resource prep. Capturing the links in presentations and making sure there is a doc in the archive repo.


### Meet Ups Core Goals

- A monthly presentation and socializing event except for November and December.
- At least 1 workshop.
- Always free

The meet ups are opportunity for the tech community to get together. This is also opportunity for those interested in tech, but may not working in tech to engage with the Eugene tech community.

### Connecting People

There is a lot of interest in tech and not every group has someone to lead a discussion about current tech and industry. Some big questions need to be answered in Eugene.

- What does the tech community even look like at this point?
- How should we communicate moving forward?
- How has remote changed our community?
- How does acquisitions or folding of tech businesses affected the community?
- What can be done to asses the community size?
- What needs does the community have?

In general Eugene Web Devs should keep doing wht it has done. Monthly presentations for Developers. However if another group is leading in addressing the above questions This meet up group will support in any way useful with out detracting from the core goals.

### In Industry

Every employer wants to train employees, but the reality of it comes down to time and money. Very often one or both of these are too short of supply. Workshops can help with simple trainings on common technologies. While not a real substitute for proper training by a business, a small workshop can help someone get past the initial steps in learning a new skill.

An example of this was a Eugene Web Devs workshop on Docker. This is re usable and relevant information. Again this workshop didn't get anyone using docker exactly like a particular company would, but getting the basic concepts and running through a couple small exercises is much more than starting from nothing with nobody to ask questions to.

The tech industry is also many other positions beyond devs. For example designers, PMs, support, QA, and games. Engaging these aspects of tech is a challenge, but one that could help spread a better understanding of all these fit together to make up a tech business.


### In Educations

Schools in particular have a lot of interest. Speaking at classroom or creating an event that students can participate in helps build the tech community by introducing students to a community outside the classrooms.

Those interested can be connected to schools via educators and an agreed upon speaking engagement can be defined. This definition is important to be respectful of time for all parties involved.

Holding this definition as an offer to interested educators allows this or another group to find individuals to represent the tech community. This also allows multiple individuals to participate. This offer does not ahve to be under the Eugene Web Devs name.

Being available for mentoring at a school run event is also a something the tech community can aid with.

### Community Events

Events are no easy task. A tech event in particular adds technical challenges. Past popular events like Hack for a Cause met these challenges and were a good city wide event for those in tech. While not organizing a hackathon is not a goal helping organize the tech side for developer experience is something that this community can help with.

Additionally having purposeful events outside the tech community that are more general interest can help spread the word about a tech scene in Eugene. In the past an non technical meet up on timely topics like SEO or AI have been well attended and draw in the general community. Targeting these and partnering with another organization seems like a good direction for growth and extending reach.

There may be other organizations that are interested in hearing about tech from someone in that industry. This could be a place for a presenter to give a less technical version of a talk.


### Beyond Eugene?

Web Devs presentations could be done multiple times. Fining a resource in Corvallis and Bend could help maximize the effort put in by a presenter.

## Sponsorships?

While this not a for money organization, help is always appreciated and in the past has gone to things like AV equipment.
